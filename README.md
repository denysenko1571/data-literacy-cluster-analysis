# 📊 Hierarchical Clustering Analysis of Data Literacy Teaching Strategies

This repository contains my Hierarchical Clustering project, completed as part of my coursework for the Data Literacy Systems Systematic Literature Review 
It demonstrates my skills in Python, data preprocessing, exploratory clustering, and pattern extraction from academic literature datasets.

## 🔍 Research Questions

 - What interventions effectively support the development of data literacy? 
 - How do the characteristics of such interventions interplay to develop data skills and
what research agenda could be derived to advance data literacy?

## ✨ Features

- Hierarchical Clustering Analysis using Ward's method and Euclidean distance.
- Recommendation Engine to suggest optimal clustering distance levels based on cluster variance.
- Dendrogram Visualization to explore the grouping of different studies.

- Cluster Interpretation via:
  - Attribute Occurrence Statistics (e.g., how often certain teaching strategies appear in clusters).
  - Most Frequent Attribute Combinations inside each cluster.

- Clear Output Presentation for better understanding of cluster contents.
